# Thanks For Downloading These Missions. This pack is part of a series of mission packs I have done in the past.  The next pack I will work on is the Government Missions and Kerbal Institute Special Missions.. These will continue the story of these 2 programs in separate packs.  Look for them soon.# 7/1/2013 Updated the code a little and added an extra bonus mission.. The Commercialization of space has been changed in this version.. Now you have to obit for days... And not An Orbital Period.. The bonus mission now has the orbital period mission.  I do some more code clean up later.. (just found out about the tab key... LOL)
# 7/2/2013 Did some more code clean up making it a lot more neat and proper spacing.. Look at me learning how to be neat.. 
# 7/3/2013 Added another mission for you KeoSync orbit lovers out there.. Check out the last mission.. Good Luck

    name = Malkuths International Civilian Space Program Basic Missions
	description = These missions are used in Malkuths Lets Plays International Civilian Space Program, as always there might be some bugs in the missions.  If there are you can report them to me by PM on the kerbal Space Program Forums and I will fix them up right away.  There are  A Few Special Story Based Missions In This pack.. 3 Of them to be exact.  The Government.. And Kerbal Institute and the Commercialization of space.. All these missions are story based and will be continued in their own packs at a later time.. But for now enjoy these missions.. There are 23 in total.  Many of them are repeatable.  Check out the bonus missions, some have different inclinations where it makes sense.  THESE missions are made to work alongside a sandbox game.. Like making your own ships and launching them?  You still can!!  The payouts for these missions are high enough to pay for the missions.. And pay for your own space adventures and plans to boot..  So good luck and have fun.. And give me some love and subscribe to my YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/malkuth1974

The Long Line Company that has supplied communications for all these years are suing us to stop these satellites.. They say The Satellites will cost millions of kerbals There Job that Keep The Current Communications system that runs from their headquarters to around the world. Progress will not be Stopped and we are going for it anyway. These Missions can be done multiple times.. They are available for you to set up your own communications network around the Kerbin..

Your job is to get 1 kerbal in a orbit around kerbin for 2 Hours time.  There are certain parts that need to be on the vessel to make this system work.. We will start with only 1 kerbal at this time though.  Please note that a Insurance Cost for all passengers is in effect for these types of missions.. And Of course you must land safely.. The more of the vessel you can save when land.. The more money you will make.  Cost is important.  Don't lose the prototype or we will be fined.. It’s a contract thing.. Not including the cost of the Kerbals lost!  Since this vessel is a prototype of a Space Cruise Liner you must have a Cupola and a Hitch-hiker Cabin installed in the prototype..

			description = An Older Kerbal Comes into your office.. Does not knock and tells you that you will take him to the moon now...  You kinda look at him funny.. He starts to raise his voice I will pay you 400,000 If you take me to the moon.. You fall out of your chair and hit your head on the floor.. Get up real quick and now see 2 men... Hoping the reward just doubled.. You hopes are quickly dashed when the 2 men form back into 1....  You ask why go moon.. The man says Don't worry about it.. I will pay you.. But you have to follow my directions!  Then starts mumbling about Arches In his foot.. Or Moon or something... He looks familiar.... Like you seen him before.. No matter lets get going...  Oh I need this much power to run my machines... That ship is big enough for my machine right?  (note this mission requires some maths... ) :)  Good Luck.
