name = Contract Missions (Random Generator)
description = This is Where you Choose your Contract Missions. The Contract Generator is a work in process. This is release Candidate 1.  It only generates a few missions including the New Repair Mission.  Repair Missions are pretty rare and you must have at least 1 Vessel in space with a Repair Part.  The Other 3 missions are generic Satellite missions.
