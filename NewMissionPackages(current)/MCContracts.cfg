name = Contract Missions (Random Generator)
description = This is the contract generator. It generates random contracts for you In game every 24 hours.  There are a possible list of 3 categories that can show up in those 24 hours.\n \n The categories are Special missions, SOI Missions, and Rover Missions.  Every contract is random and you are not guaranteed to get a contract in those 24 hours.  You can have 0 contracts available or all 3 types.\n \n This is Build 3 of the Contract Generator.  The newest categories Rover Missions is a work in progress.
