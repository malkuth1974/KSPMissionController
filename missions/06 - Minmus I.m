Mission
{
    name = Minmus I
    description = Our top scientists are satisfied with our Mun missions and have requested a mission to Kerbal's second orbiting body: Minmus. Its smaller size and higher orbit limits the amount of data we have about its composition, so this mission will require you to crash a rocket into its surface to collect data on its composition and density. (Yes, crash. Observations from Kerbal will allow us to capture the required data remotely.)

    reward = 80000
